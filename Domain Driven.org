Domain is real world problem in programing abstraction, like bank system has accounts, banks, debits... 

A special domain + domain vocabulary = bounded context 

3 type object: 

Entity: has an entity, has different state in lifecycle 

Value object: semantically immutable, can be shared 

Service: more macro-level abstraction than entity and object, involve multiple entity and value object, usally business case 

3 pattern to manipulate: 

Factories, generate entity 

Aggregates, root of entity and object 

Repositories, persistent entity 

Responsibility: Resilience + Elasticity + Message Driven 

Resilince means handle failure, for software and hardwarendle failuring
