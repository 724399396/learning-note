* basic
System interface design:
- provide library, pros: efficent, cons: not controll by system
- system call, split to user mode and kernel mode

process is unix isolation unit, process keep state, memory page, user stack ,kernal statk info

user use low virutal address, kernel use high virtual address

when pc boot, read from disk boot loader, boot loader is series instruction, kernal start address(0x800000000) map to physical address 0x0, so boot loader size limit is 4Mi
