* Basic
** Syntax
   #define <source> <aliase>
   >> logical shift
   >>> airthmetical
   & | ^ ~ is bit operation
   && || is boolean opeartion
   & get address
   sizeof get variable size(in byte)
   malloc alloc byte number memory
   realloc re-alloc a pointer to new size
   void * is machine special pointer
   %u unsigned, %d signed, %x decimal, %p pointer
   struct <option name> { ... } define struct, *s.x equal s->x, struct inner field is under other namespace, struct <type> <variable> = {<initial>} to initial, structure can include self pointer
   \0 is char ending, NULL is 0
   #include <> standard library, #include "" is currency directory header file
   typedef <origin> <alias>
   external variable is reference from other file
   enum <enum name>{<value 1>, <value 2>..} declare enum
   const means variable can't be change, can use at parameter
   static, two usage, first is let those definition not public to outside, second is keep field not re-initialize
   register, suggest compiler assign auto variable(parameter, local variable) to register
   #undef cancel #define
   #if <condition> #endif
   #ifndef or #ifdef check define
   (* name) is pointer to function
   ...is means any number, any type parameter, only possible on last argument, va_list is type, va_start intialize, va_arg get one and step one, var_end clear
 0 is false, otherwise is true
 read binary file should use char to receive response, if use unsigned, 0xff will convert to -1
 <limits.h> define kinds of number type bound
 if signed and unsigned operation mix, will implicit convert to unsigned, if need add bit, first add bit then convert
 pointer arithmetic is base on sizeof pointer type
 c parameter pass is by value on stack
 x & (x-1) can clear right most bit
 || and && precedence is not sure, use prancese to ensure
 + + precedence is high than *, so *p++ is equal (*p)++
 char [] = "" is different from char * = "", first will allocate on stack, modify will affect this memory, second is point to const "", modify is undefined
 two-dim array, the second dim size must be set
 [] precedence is high than *, *++argv[0] is point to argv[0][1], (*++argv)[0] is point to argv[1][0]
* gcc
  -O set optimize level
  -S generate assembly code
  -m32 32 bit 
  -c generate object code
  -o execute file name
  -masm=intel, default is att
* gdb
  x/17xb
  objdump -d <objectFile> can deassembly output assembly file
* Assembly
  movb %dh, %al, move %dh to %dl
  stack descrese from high to low
* Makefile
  CC set compiler
  CFLAGS set compiler options
  EXE set executable file name
  HDRS set header file
  LIB set library file
  SRCS source file
* API
 strlen is size of character, not include \0
 fopen open new file, get a file descriptor
 fprintf(fd, character) output to fd
 flose(fd) close a file descriptor
 xrand48 use to generate random value, srand48 set seed
 fgets(fd) get character from fd one by one
 getchar() get character from stdin
 putchar() put character to stdout
 strcat(char *[], char* []) concat str
 squeeze(char *[], char) delete special char
 strpbrk(char *[], char *[]) location sub-str
 strstr(char *[], char *[]) location sub-str
 strchr(s,c) location sub-str
 getbits(x,p,n) return n bit start from p of x
 isspace
 isdigit
 strtol convert string to long
 strtod convert string to double
 system("xx") call command xx
* Tools
 echo $? get previous command exit code
 xxd -c <line_byte_number> -g <group_number> -s <offset> <input file> explore file by hex value
 valgrind is a memory check util, usage: valgrind -v --leak-check=full <execute file>
