* target
  - ACCEPT allow a package to continue on its way
  - DROP drops a packet. Not further processing is performed, and as far as the receiving stack is concerned, it is as though the packet was never sent.
  - LOG logs a packet to syslog
  - REJECT drops a packet and simulaneously sends an appropriate response packet(e.g., a tcp reset packet for a tcp connection or an iCMP Port Unreachable messafe for a UDP packet).
  - RETURN Continues processing a packet within the calling chain.
