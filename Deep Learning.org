* Basic
  Artificial Intelligence include Machine learning, Machine learning include deep learing
  symbolic AI is programmer handcraft a sufficiently large set of exlicit rules
  symbolic AI: data + rule -> result, machine learning: data + result -> rule
  machine learning need 3 things:
  1. input data points
  2. examples of the expected output
  3. a way to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job
  machine larning is searching for useful representations of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from a feedback signal.
  deep learning "deep" is on successive layer of representations
  deep learning almost always learned via models called neural networks
  deep learning is adjust every layer weight(parameter)
  loss function(objective function) is used to measure how for output is from what expected
  use loss function adjust weight is called optimizer, implement by Backpropagation algorithm
* Keras
