| split task to multiple sub task, use multiple core to run at same time | reponse multiple task in 'same time', not care does it really run same time |

concurrency is nondeterminism

parrallel is hirechay:
- bit level, cpu process on word level is parrallel for bit level
- instruction level, pipe line is instruction parrallel
- task level, this is programmer should consider most time

parrallel is not for all scenario, e.g sum a array bottleneck is access all element(memory speed)

execute time = D(e) + W(e) / P, D is task split level, W is task step number, P is thread number

improve: 1 / ((1-p) + p/n)), p is parallel percent, n is parallel number
